Call `web_collect_evidence` exactly once with assignment ID `{{ doc.assignment_id }}`, 3-6 distinct queries from the query plan above, and `max_sources` 6. It performs the complete capped network retrieval; this deployment exposes no raw network tools. Persist at least two useful integrity-verified bundled sources, copying every retrieval-quality and quote-verification field exactly and encoding array fields as compact JSON strings. Each source write must include the required `primary_source` string (`true` or `false`) and `relevance` as one short assignment-specific sentence; only `published_at` is optional. Then write 6-8 atomic claims and at least one typed evidence link per claim. Evidence links reference the authoritative source by `source_id`; they do not duplicate its fetch ID, hash, or quote-verification state. Downstream stages derive exactness by comparing an excerpt with the source's verified quote. Stable source, claim, and evidence IDs must begin with `{{ doc.assignment_id }}:`. Never retry a successful write. Call `write_research_investigation` exactly once as the final write, only after at least two sources, six claims, and six evidence links are durable, with copied bundle diagnostics and a `complete` or `partial` status. Do not supply runtime-filled `run_id`, `assignment_id`, `expected_total`, or ledger counts.
