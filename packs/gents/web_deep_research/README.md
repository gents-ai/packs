# Web deep research

Reusable planning, investigation, adjudication and reporting graph.
Install with `gents pack install web_deep_research --home <home>`.
Use `gents pack show web_deep_research` for entry/result contracts and external
dependencies, then `gents graph run web_deep_research --help` for run inputs.
Installation binds its `coordinator`, `researcher`, and `verifier` slots to
existing profiles owned by the selected principal.

## Configuration and authority

Inference resolves through each task's behavior and bound user profile. The
contexts, exact MCP tool names, datastore surfaces, tasks, capabilities and
graph intent are authored once in `pack_config.json`; inference connectivity
and model settings remain on existing user configuration.
Installation binds their owner to the requested principal. Declared external
services must be provisioned by the operator; installing a pack does not execute
dependency install commands. The host's tool ceiling still constrains every
configured capability.

## Inputs, outputs and completion

The entry research job drives a plan and parallel investigations. Adjudication
feeds the final research result. The graph result contracts, not model prose,
define successful completion. Watch, inspect results, or cancel through the
ordinary `gents graph` commands.

## Verification and history

Bundled catalog and compiler tests validate the assets and graph contracts.
Keep future run summaries and issue links here; do not commit raw node homes
or credentials.

## Declared topology

Compiled capability edges.

## Tests

`tests/graphs.json` pins the compiled graph (`web-deep-research`). A graph pack installs
only from the gents binary today, so the suite checks, builds, verifies and
compiles it rather than installing it. Run it with `make test-web_deep_research`
from the repository root.
