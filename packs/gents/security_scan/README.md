# Whole-codebase security scan pack

This pack scans the **entire tree**, not a diff. It differs from
`code_review` (reviews a PR diff) and `repo_maintenance` (a cleanup round)
in scope, and it borrows deepsec's economics: a free mechanical regex
pre-scan decides *what* gets investigated, and paid model stages decide
*how deep*.

Runtime configuration is authored once in `pack_config.json`. The distribution
`manifest.json` points to that canonical bundle and lists it with the schema and
prompt sidecars needed to install the pack; there are no per-collection JSON
document fragments. AgentContext, Tools, Task, EventSource, and Trigger
documents in that bundle define all four stages.

[runner kickoff: ported scan engine runs, output embedded in the single seed doc]

ScanJob ──▶ scan-plan (planner)
              candidates arrive via {{ doc.candidates }}
              → writes N × InvestigationBatch (each stamps expected_total = N)
InvestigationBatch ──▶ scan-investigate × N
              self-contained evidence packet via {{ doc.* }}
              → CandidateFinding* + exactly 1 InvestigationResult sentinel
[N sentinels, fire_mode per_group] ──▶ scan-revalidate (single barrier consumer)
              {{ group.docs }} is the sentinel set; load rows with
              query_candidate_finding (bound to CandidateFinding)
              → 1 FindingVerdict per candidate + 1 RevalidationSummary
                (written last)
RevalidationSummary ──▶ scan-report
              load rows with query_finding_verdict
              → confirmed Finding* + 1 ScanReport
```

Four triggers, all `event_kind: created`: `scan-plan` (on `ScanJob`),
`scan-investigate` (on `InvestigationBatch`, `fire_mode: per_document`,
parallel), `scan-revalidate` (on `InvestigationResult`, `fire_mode:
per_group`, `correlation_field: run_id`, `expected_count_field:
expected_total`), `scan-report` (on `RevalidationSummary`). This is the
same trigger-edge shape `code_review` established: closed cardinality
stamped at fan-out, a sentinel-gated barrier, a write-last summary
contract, and an exact candidate-to-verdict bijection enforced by the
runner.

## Self-sufficient carrier documents

Trigger edges still deliver their local payload through prompt template
injection (`{{ doc.* }}`, `{{ group.docs }}` for the sentinel barrier).
But typed finding and verdict **rows** are read with single-collection
surface query tools - not the generic `defra_query` console, and not JSON
copies stuffed into sentinels. `scan-revalidate` gets `query_candidate_finding`
(bound to `CandidateFinding`); `scan-report` gets `query_finding_verdict`
(bound to `FindingVerdict`). Each is bound to exactly the collection that
stage needs, with `run_id` runtime-filled from correlation and hidden
from model input - the model can call the tool but never sees or sets the
run identity. Sentinels stay thin (`InvestigationResult`,
`RevalidationSummary`) the same way `code_review` keeps `ScanResult`
thin: they carry counts, not payload, and the next stage loads the real
rows itself.

Payload discipline throughout is **complete inventory, truncated
evidence**: caps never silently drop items. A path+slug inventory line is
always complete; only excerpts truncate, and every truncation is recorded
as an overflow count in the same document.

## Matchers

The pre-scan is a Rust port of deepsec's regex matcher registry
(gents `crates/gents-cli/src/commands/pack/secscan/matchers.rs`), curated for a
Rust/polyglot repo. Each matcher has a noise tier - `precise` sorts first
into the candidate payload, `noisy` last - and its own discovery test that
asserts its example snippet fires.

| Slug | Tier | Flags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `secrets-exposure` | precise | Hardcoded API keys, tokens, or passwords in source. |
| `graphql-injection` | precise | GraphQL built with `format!` interpolation - verify `escape_graphql_string` is applied to every interpolated value. |
| `defra-empty-array` | precise | Empty `[]` literal inside a DefraDB mutation string - types as `JsonArray` and corrupts nillable array columns; emit `null` instead. |
| `secret-in-fallback` | precise | Secret env var read with a hardcoded fallback value. |
| `insecure-crypto` | precise | Weak hash algorithms (MD5/SHA-1) in a security context. |
| `secret-in-log` | normal | Credentials or tokens flowing into log statements. |
| `command-injection` | normal | Shell invocation with interpolated or `-c` arguments - verify inputs cannot reach the shell. |
| `webhook-handler` | normal | Webhook ingress - verify signature/authenticity checks before trusting the payload. |
| `path-traversal` | noisy | Filesystem join with request/user-derived path segments - verify canonicalization/containment. |
| `missing-auth` | noisy | HTTP route registration - verify authentication/authorization wraps the handler directly. |

`graphql-injection` and `defra-empty-array` are gents-native additions,
not part of deepsec's upstream taxonomy: they encode this repository's
two documented sharp edges (see `AGENTS.md`) - every GraphQL
interpolation must pass `escape_graphql_string`, and a DefraDB mutation
must never emit an empty `[]` literal. Both are `precise` tier because
they check syntactic project law rather than a fuzzy security heuristic,
and both feed straight into `scan-investigate`'s system prompt, which
tells investigators to treat violations as real findings.

## Stages

- **scan-plan** batches candidate files deepsec-style - roughly five
  files per batch, precise-tier first, related files grouped - and
  decides the complete batch list and immutable `expected_total` before
  its first write. Read-only file tools only; no shell, no network.
- **scan-investigate** (× N, parallel) gets one self-contained batch:
  read-only file tools, native `lsp`, unrestricted bash rooted at the
  scan root (targeted `cargo`/tests, `git log`/`git blame`), and
  background process tools for long commands. It writes
  `CandidateFinding` rows, then exactly one `write_investigation_result`
  as its final write.
- **scan-revalidate** is the single barrier consumer: it fires once all N
  `InvestigationResult` sentinels for the run exist, loads every typed
  candidate with `query_candidate_finding`, re-inspects each one (file
  context, git history - "was this fixed?"), and writes one
  `FindingVerdict` per candidate plus one `RevalidationSummary` whose
  `confirmed_count` + `refuted_count` balance the candidate set. No
  `defra_query`, no network.
- **scan-report** loads every verdict with `query_finding_verdict` and
  publishes one `Finding` row per confirmed verdict plus exactly one
  `ScanReport`. No shell, no file tools, no network, no `defra_query`.

## Env retargeting

```bash
export GENTS_SCAN_ROOT=/path/to/repo
export GENTS_SCAN_MIN_BATCHES=4
export GENTS_SCAN_MAX_BATCHES=24
export GENTS_SCAN_MAX_PAYLOAD_CHARS=49152
```

`GENTS_SCAN_ROOT` roots the pre-scan, the file tools, and bash for the
investigate/revalidate stages, and defaults to `.`. Install binds the declared
`coordinator`, `scanner`, and `verifier` slots to existing user profiles;
their backends own connectivity and concurrency. `GENTS_SCAN_MIN_BATCHES` /
`GENTS_SCAN_MAX_BATCHES` bound how many `InvestigationBatch` rows the
planner may create; `GENTS_SCAN_MAX_PAYLOAD_CHARS` bounds the pre-scan
payload embedded in the seed `ScanJob` before excerpts truncate and,
beyond that, inventory itself drops to path-only lines counted in
`overflow_count`.

## Run it

```bash
gents pack scenario run security_scan
```

Everything a run produces lands under `packs/gents/security_scan/runs/<job_id>/`:
`results.json` with the confirmed `Finding` rows and the `ScanReport`,
`meta.json` with stage request ids and signed request-version provenance,
and timeline/adapter projection artifacts under `projections/`.

## Tests

`tests/install.json` pins the `coordinator`, `scanner`, `verifier` slots and the 29 documents an
install creates, reinstalls without change and removes. Run it with
`make test-security_scan` from the repository root.
