Scan run {{ event.correlation }} covers the repository at `{{ doc.scan_root }}`.
Focus: {{ doc.focus }}

Pre-scan inventory ({{ doc.candidate_files }} candidate files,
{{ doc.candidate_total }} candidates, slug counts {{ doc.slug_counts }},
overflow {{ doc.overflow_count }}):

{{ doc.candidates }}

Turn this inventory into between {{ doc.batch_min }} and {{ doc.batch_max }}
investigation batches. Rules:

1. About five files per batch where the batch cap allows; when the
   candidate count forces larger batches, balance file counts evenly.
   Group related files: same slug family, same module or subsystem, or
   the same vulnerability class. Precise-tier candidates lead: they get
   the earliest batch ids and the tightest grouping. Never mix a
   precise-tier file into a batch of purely noisy candidates when a
   tighter grouping exists.
2. Every candidate file appears in exactly one batch. If `overflow_count`
   is greater than zero, the inventory's path-only lines still get
   assigned - group them by directory affinity and say in the batch
   instructions that they carry no excerpt evidence.
3. If there are fewer candidate files than the minimum batch count, pad
   the batch list to the minimum by assigning the highest-risk unflagged
   source directories (authorization, persistence, and provider-boundary
   code first), and say in each padded batch's instructions that its
   files carry no pre-scan hits.
4. You may use read-only file tools to check a path exists or gauge a
   file's size when deciding a grouping; do not read files to pre-judge
   findings, and never use a shell.
5. Decide the full batch list first, then write every batch. For each
   batch call `write_investigation_batch` with:
   - `batch_id`: `{{ event.correlation }}:batch-<two-digit-index>`
   - `scan_root`: exactly `{{ doc.scan_root }}`
   - `paths`: comma-separated relative paths (at most sixteen)
   - `hits`: the inventory lines for those files, verbatim
   - `instructions`: self-contained guidance (at most 8,000 characters)
     naming the fired slugs, what each slug means, and what to verify in
     these specific files
   - `expected_total`: the total batch count, identical on every write
6. Do not supply `run_id`; it is runtime-filled. Do not finish until every
   batch has been written successfully.
