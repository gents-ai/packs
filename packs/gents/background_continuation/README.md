# Background continuation pack

This pack proves the operator-visible path behind #1114 and #1116:

Runtime configuration is authored once in `pack_config.json`. The distribution
`manifest.json` points to that canonical bundle and lists it with the schema and
prompt sidecars needed to install the pack; there are no per-collection JSON
document fragments.

```

Run it with a fresh home:

```bash
gents pack scenario run background_continuation
```

The runner requires two completed depth-positive child requests, at least one
completed canonical background-completion wake, at least two acknowledged
notification keys, and zero pending or stranded notifications. It also exports
the parent and wake timelines plus ATIF, OpenAI Codex, LangGraph, and
multi-agent projections under `runs/<job_id>/projections/`.

This provider-backed pack validates the successful end-to-end and successor-
epoch paths. Crash cuts are kept deterministic: the Lean R6 contract emits the
before-claim, during-inference, after-response-persistence, and acknowledgement
restart cases; the queue tests exercise restart recovery, persisted-response
repair, failed-wake redrive, and exact successor acknowledgement against the
real store.

## Declared topology

Document-trigger edges; task writes and host callbacks are described above.

## Tests

`tests/install.json` pins the `coordinator`, `worker` slots and the 10 documents an
install creates, reinstalls without change and removes. Run it with
`make test-background_continuation` from the repository root.
