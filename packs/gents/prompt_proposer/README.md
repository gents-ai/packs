# Prompt proposer

The prompt proposer is the model side of `gents optimization run`. It is a
single behavior, `prompt-proposer`, with a fixed system prompt and no tools:
it cannot read or write documents, files or configuration. Each round it
receives one behavior's current system instruction and the feedback a
training run produced against it, and answers with one rewritten
instruction and the rationale for it. The optimization driver, never the
proposer, decides whether the candidate is worth a validation run.

## Installation

```bash
gents pack install ./packs/gents/prompt_proposer --home <home> --inference-slot proposer=<profile_id>
gents pack install gents/prompt_proposer --home <home> --inference-slot proposer=<profile_id>   # once published to the registry
```

`gents optimization run` installs the pack into the operator's home once,
idempotently, and binds that slot to `--proposer-profile` or the home's
default profile.

## Bindings and prerequisites

The pack declares one inference slot, `proposer`, bound to the
`prompt-proposer` behavior. Nothing else is configurable: the behavior's
context is the proposing contract in
`agent_behaviors/prompt_proposer/system_prompt.md` (what the turn carries,
what to carry over from the feedback, the rules a candidate is held to, and
the reply format).

## Authority

`prompt-proposer-tools` grants no host bash and no file, datastore or
self-config tools.

## Inputs and outputs

```
gents optimization run <definition_id> --subject <pack>[:<behavior>] --proposer behavior:prompt_proposer[:<behavior>] [--proposer-profile <profile_id>]
```

The command opens a fresh session against the served home, sends the
subject's dossier (its prompt, tools, surfaces, tasks and schemas) as the
first user turn, and then sends the proposer one user turn per round: the
current instruction, every feedback line from the train run, the candidates
already rejected, the rules, and the reply shape. A reply that contains
exactly one fenced `json` block holding `text` and `rationale` is the round's
proposal.

`--proposer scripted:<file>` replays a fixed list of proposals instead and
installs nothing.

## Completion and failure

A reply that does not contain exactly one fenced `json` block with `text` and
`rationale` gets one corrective turn, and a second failure fails the run;
rerun with the same `--job-id` to resume. The driver's structural gate, not
the proposer, enforces the byte cap and the no-repeat rule.

## Validation

```bash
gents pack check ./packs/gents/prompt_proposer
gents pack test ./packs/gents/prompt_proposer
make test-prompt_proposer
```

`tests/install.json` pins the `proposer` slot and the 3 documents an install
creates, reinstalls without change and removes.
