# Eval author

The eval author is the model side of `gents eval init`. It is a single
behavior, `eval-author`, with a fixed system prompt and no tools: it cannot
read or write documents, files or configuration. It interviews an operator
about one subject behavior and drafts an eval definition - cases that will
later run against that subject and grade what it does.

## Configuration

The pack declares one inference slot, `author`, bound to the `eval-author`
behavior. `gents eval init` installs the pack into the operator's home once,
idempotently, and binds that slot to `--profile` or the home's default
profile. Nothing else is configurable: the behavior's context is the
authoring contract in `agent_behaviors/eval_author/system_prompt.md` (the
case vocabulary, the worked example, the seven rules drafts are held to, the
five interview questions, and the draft reply format), and its tools
document grants no host bash and no file, datastore or self-config tools.

## Usage

```
gents eval init <subject-pack> --out <dir> [--behavior <id>] [--profile <profile_id>] [--pilot]
```

The command opens a fresh `AgentSession` against the served home, sends the
subject dossier and the check catalog as the first turn, and runs an ordinary
chat-turn loop between the operator and the author. A reply that contains
exactly one fenced `json` block is a draft. The CLI - never the author  - 
validates it: check names against the catalog, params against each check's
schema, captures against the subject's collections and fields, split and
case-id shape, and a full pack-loader round trip in a scratch directory. Only
a draft that survives every step is written under `--out`. The author holds no
write grants at any point; nothing reaches disk or live configuration before
validation passes.

`gents eval checks` prints the same catalog the author sees.

## Tests

`tests/install.json` pins the `author` slots and the 3 documents an
install creates, reinstalls without change and removes. Run it with
`make test-eval_author` from the repository root.
