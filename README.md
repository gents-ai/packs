# Gents packs

The official Gents packs. Every pack here publishes under the `gents`
namespace and lives at `packs/gents/<name>/`, with its tests inside it.

A pack distributes behaviors, tasks, datastore tools, schemas, prompts and
supporting assets. It may contain a compiled graph, a document-driven worked
scenario, or reusable assets alone.

```sh
gents pack list
gents pack show code_review
gents pack install code_review --home <initialized-home>
gents graph run code_review --field base=origin/main --field head=HEAD
gents pack install mailbox --home <home>
gents pack remove mailbox --home <home>
gents pack prune mailbox
gents pack scenario run pipeline --http-port 19191 --keep-home
```

## What a pack is made of

A pack directory holds `manifest.json` and the assets that manifest declares.
Nothing that is not declared travels, so the manifest is the whole description
of the pack, and the pack's digest is computed over exactly what it declares.

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 1,
  "name": "shipping_plugins",
  "namespace": "acme",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "What this pack is for",
  "authors": ["you"],
  "tags": ["plugins"],
  "kind": "plugins",
  "assets": ["README.md", "plugins/format_check.afb"],
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "format_check",
      "description": "What the model is told this does",
      "artifact": "plugins/format_check.afb",
      "source": "plugins/format_check",
      "language": "rust",
      "input_schema": { "type": "object", "properties": {} },
      "manifold": { "fs": { "ReadOnly": ["/workspace"] }, "net": "None" }
    }
  ]
}
```

`namespace` is the registry namespace this pack publishes under, and the
other half of its coordinate (`acme/shipping_plugins`). It is optional and
`gents` when absent, so a first-party pack does not repeat it. A pack's
plugins install under the pack's namespace, so two packs from different
namespaces may each carry a `format_check` without one replacing the other.
Within one namespace, a plugin record is owned by the pack coordinate that
installed it: installing a same-named plugin from a different pack is
refused, naming both packs, and only that pack's own reinstall or update
replaces its record. `gents pack remove` releases only what its own
coordinate owns.

`kind` is `documents`, `graph`, `assets`, or `plugins`. A `plugins` pack
installs no documents of its own: it exists to ship capabilities. Its plugins
land in the same store `gents plugin install` uses, one store per home, so
they are callable by name whichever pack put them there and one pack can
build on another's capabilities instead of vendoring a copy.

## Plugins

A plugin is a complete Afterburner `.afb`: publishable and installable on its
own, and also carried inside a pack as one of its declared assets. It is the
one artifact every language Afterburner compiles down to, since some of them
(Python to an emscripten-pyodide bundle, for instance) have no bare-`.wasm`
form to ship instead, and only Afterburner's own runtime knows how to
dispatch every one of those shapes.

Today a plugin is called directly, by name (`gents plugin run`). Offering the
same admitted plugin to a graph stage and to a model as an ordinary tool is
the reason it is one definition rather than two, and neither of those call
paths is wired yet. Its bytes sit in a content-addressed store separate from
the per-name record, so installing a second version never disturbs the
first; `gents pack remove` releases a digest's bytes once no installed record
anywhere in the home references it any more, and keeps them otherwise. A
plugin declares:

- `artifact`, the compiled `.afb` inside the pack, under `plugins/`. It must
  also appear in `assets`, so the pack's own digest covers it and nothing can
  be swapped underneath the name it was admitted under.
- `source`, optionally, where the artifact is built from. `gents pack build`
  compiles it through Afterburner, whatever language `language` names.
- `language`, the source language `source` is written in: `rust`, `go`,
  `c`, `cpp`, `python`, `ruby`, `js`, or `ts` (see
  `afterburner::cli::compile::lang::SourceLang` for the exact accepted
  spellings). Required even for a plugin that ships only a compiled artifact.
  Every one of them compiles, and every one of them runs under the bounds a
  call applies. What decides that is the compiled artifact, not the language
  name: whether a given `.afb` can be run with `stdin`, fuel, memory, a wall
  clock and its manifold grants all enforced is asked of Afterburner itself
  at admission, and a plugin that cannot be is refused by name rather than
  run with a bound silently missing.
- `input_schema`, which is what a model is shown.
- `manifold`, what the plugin asks the sandbox to allow. Absent means it asks
  for nothing, which is right for a pure transform. At admission the grant
  is narrowed to what the plugin declared and to gents' fixed ceiling, which
  is sealed today: an admitted plugin gets no filesystem, network or
  environment access, whatever it declares. A plugin may not listen on a
  port: a pack's plugins are called, never served.

The call ABI is deliberately narrow: canonical JSON arguments arrive on
standard input, one JSON value is written to standard output, and standard
error is diagnostics.

## Building and publishing

```sh
gents pack build packs/shipping_plugins                # compile the plugins, write one .pack
gents pack verify acme.shipping_plugins-0.1.0.pack     # check it against its digest
gents pack publish acme.shipping_plugins-0.1.0.pack    # push it to the registry
gents pack install acme/shipping_plugins               # from the registry, anywhere
gents pack install ./acme.shipping_plugins-0.1.0.pack  # or from the file
gents pack install sha256:<hex>                        # or from this home's store
```

A plugin is also managed on its own, without a pack around it:

```sh
gents plugin build ./format_check          # compile one .afb
gents plugin publish format_check-0.1.0.afb
gents plugin install acme/format_check
gents plugin list
gents plugin run acme/format_check --input '{"path":"src"}'
gents plugin remove acme/format_check
```

Installing a pack of any kind installs the plugins it declares into the same
store `gents plugin install` uses, so a plugin that arrived inside a pack is
runnable by name exactly like one installed alone. `documents` and `graph`
packs install their plugins the same way `assets` and `plugins` packs do,
before writing their own documents or graph. If that later write fails, the
plugin records this install just wrote are restored to what they were
before it, so the pack install is all-or-nothing from the operator's view.

A built pack is one `.pack` file: a gzip-compressed tar any archive tool can
list. Its first entry, `pack.json`, states the format version, the pack digest,
coordinate, version and kind; then come `manifest.json` and every asset the
manifest declares, including each plugin's compiled `.afb`, in the order the
digest is computed over. A pack is named by its digest, `sha256:<hex>`, and a
home keeps the packs it has seen under `packs/store/sha256/`. A path is local
only when written as one (`./dir`, `../dir`, `/abs`, or a `.pack` file); a
bare name means `gents/<name>`. The registry serves
packs only: `gents plugin publish` wraps a plugin in a single-plugin pack, so
a pack that ships plugins is one artifact rather than an archive plus a pile
of modules.

The default registry is `https://registry.dev.gents.xyz`, overridable per
command with `--registry` and by `GENTS_REGISTRY`.

A pack installed from a registry is the same pack as the one built from its
directory: the digest is over the declared contents, never over the container,
so neither the route a pack took nor the compression it arrived under changes
what it is. A download is checked against the digest the registry advertised
before it is opened.

## Installation and execution

No pack ships inside the gents binary. `pack install`, `pack show` and
`pack scenario run` resolve their argument in this order: an explicit
directory, `.pack` file or `sha256:<hex>` digest; the pack already installed
in the home; the home's pack store (works offline); then the registry, whose
download is kept in the store. `NAME` means `gents/NAME`, and `NS/NAME@VERSION`
pins a version (`pack update` installs the registry's latest this way).
`pack fetch SPEC --store` fills the store without installing, from a
directory, a `.pack` or the registry, and `pack list` lists it. Graph packs
install from any of these sources, exactly like document packs: graph packs
use the runtime graph installer; document packs use schema-first desired-state
application. Neither submits scenario seed documents nor prunes
unrelated configuration. Enabled schedules and triggers can execute when their
configuration is applied to a serving node; installation is not a dry run.
Asset-only packs are materialized beneath `<home>/packs/`.
Dependencies are coordinates (`name` or `ns/name`, never a pinned version).
Declared graph dependencies are installed before the document pack, resolved
like any other pack; pre-store them with `pack fetch --store` to install
offline. This is not an atomic multi-package transaction. Failures remain visible and installs
can be retried through the existing owners.
Only document packs currently declare package dependencies, and those must be
graph packs. Graph/asset dependency lists are rejected; recursive installation
is not silently implied. Installing a document pack adds its coordinate to
each dependency's `required_by`; an install that is already a dependency and
is now also requested directly marks it explicit.

`pack remove` works for every kind. Assets and plugins packs write a file
record at `<home>/pack-installs/<namespace>/<name>.json` on install; remove
checks for that record before ever resolving an owner or opening a node, and
needs only `--home`. Removal releases the cache version (a version carrying
`runs/`, or one this pack never marked, is kept and reported under
`retained`), the plugin records this coordinate still owns, and plugin bytes
and imported archives nothing else references. A graph pack is recorded in
the same `PackInstallation` a document pack uses and removed in one
transaction: every revision the package has ever produced (including a
retired one) and its derived triggers are deleted along with the package's
own documents; removal is refused while any of the package's graphs has a
run that has not reached a terminal status, naming the graph and the run.
Package SDL schemas cannot be dropped by DefraDB and are reported under
`retained`, never silently kept without saying so; `GraphRun` history stays,
though its result view needs the graph reinstalled to show again. Removing a
document pack releases the last non-explicit claim on each of its
dependencies; removing a pack directly while another installed pack still
depends on it is refused, naming the dependents. `pack outdated` and `pack
update` list both node-recorded and file-recorded installs.

Graph and document packs declare named inference slots in `manifest.json`.
Inspect them with `pack show`, then use `pack install --preview` to see the
principal's existing profiles and the effective slot map without writing.
Bind ambiguous installs explicitly with repeated
`--inference-slot name=profile_id`. Only a one-slot/one-usable-profile install
auto-binds. Packs do not author inference backends, profiles, endpoints,
credentials, models, sampling, or execution settings; the bound user profile
remains their sole owner. Packs bind to the target node through existing
identity checks. Review plugin declarations and host authority before
installing untrusted content. External dependency commands are documentation,
never automatically executed.

`pack scenario run`, `init`, and `seed` operate `experiment.json` scenarios. A
source directory can be used while authoring; a name resolves as `pack install`
resolves one. `pack scenario run --with-pack DIR_OR_PACK` admits a directory
or `.pack` to the run's store first, so a graph dependency resolves offline.
Run artifacts are under the resolved pack's `runs/<job_id>/`.
Repository-specific scenarios still need their documented checkout, tools and
bindings; a pack does not provision a compiler or an external model endpoint.
A scenario's `prepare` steps run a pack plugin (optionally with one
operator-bound read-only directory) and map its output to seed fields.

`manifest.json` is the sole package dependency declaration, including for
scenario runs. `experiment.json` may configure scenario-specific graph model
bindings, but cannot declare another dependency list.

The scenario asset cache of a name-resolved pack is separate from the runtime
home selected with `pack scenario run --home`: it lives under the default Gents
home's `packs/` tree.
The distribution digest covers all declared assets, including documentation;
the graph execution digest covers only the graph's referenced inputs. Both use
the existing graph asset hashing routine. Filesystem cache names use the hex
portion of the shared `sha256:` digest format. `pack prune <name> [--home <home>]`
removes superseded generated versions with no `runs/`. It takes the exclusive
per-pack cache lock; scenario operations retain a shared lock for their full
lifetime. Versions holding run history and directories without Gents'
ownership marker are retained.
Omit `--home` to prune the same default cache used by named scenario runs; pass
the same explicit `--home` used to install an asset pack when pruning that
cache.

`gents graph run/watch/result/cancel/enable/disable` remain graph operations.
The former `graph install/catalog` and `demo` pack subcommands are removed.
`gents demo` is removed; there is no alternate demo shell or compatibility command.

## Authoring standard

Each `packs/gents/<snake_case_name>/manifest.json` declares:

- `manifest_version`, `name`, `"namespace": "gents"`, semantic `version`, and
  `description`;
- `authors`, `tags`, and `kind` (`graph`, `documents`, or `assets`);
- explicit `assets` and package-name `dependencies`;
- `inference_slots`, with a stable name, description, and the behavior IDs
  assigned to each slot, for every pack that installs behaviors;
- for graph packs, compiler version, roles, schemas, intent and capabilities.

Use snake_case directories and filenames, except conventional ecosystem names
such as `README.md` and `Cargo.toml`. No old-name aliases are provided. Changing
filesystem handles does not require renaming Task IDs or database collections.
Desired-state roots and export use snake_case collection directories too.
Every authored behavior references its slot as
`gents:inference-slot:<name>`. Do not ship `InferenceBackend`,
`InferenceProfile`, sampling, execution, or retry documents and do not use
endpoint/model environment substitutions as a second inference owner.

Installation stamps `gents:pack:<pack_name>` onto every pack-authored document
whose canonical type has tags, merging it with authored discovery tags. This
tag supports UI filtering and provenance inspection only: references determine
execution and tags grant no deletion or authorization authority. User profiles
and backends referenced by slot bindings are never stamped.

A README must explain purpose, installation, bindings/prerequisites, tool and
workspace authority, inputs/outputs, completion/failure semantics, validation,
and operational history. Graphs must include a Mermaid diagram. Refresh a
graph pack's generated topology section, and check a pack the way an install
would, with:

```sh
gents pack graph packs/gents/<name> --write-readme
gents pack check packs/gents/<name>
```

`gents pack check` reports missing and undeclared files, configuration and
graph errors, event-source filters the schemas reject, and a stale README
diagram, each by name, and writes nothing. The diagram reflects compiled
capability edges; document writes and callbacks must additionally be explained
in prose. A diagram is not proof of runtime completion behavior.

Keep concise run summaries, reviewed outputs and issue links. Never bundle
`runs/`, node homes, credentials, build caches or raw logs. Package embedding
uses declared assets, not recursive discovery of an operator's workspace.
There is no GitHub source.

## Tests

Every pack carries its own suite in `tests/`, declared in its `assets` like
any other file, so nothing skips it. `scripts/test-pack.sh <dir>` runs it:

1. `gents pack build`, and the built `.pack` verified against its digest;
2. `gents pack test`: the check an install runs and every plugin's cases
   (`plugins/<name>/tests/*.json`);
3. every `tests/*.json` case, each one expectation:

| Case | Asserts |
| --- | --- |
| `{"graphs": [...]}` | the graph ids the pack compiles to |
| `{"install": {"documents": [...], "slots": [...], "dependencies": [...]}}` | installed from its directory into a fresh `gents init` home, the pack binds these inference slots, installs these dependency packs and creates exactly these documents; a reinstall creates nothing new; `gents pack remove` deletes exactly these |
| `{"install": {"assets": [...]}}` | installed into a fresh home, an assets pack materializes exactly these files; `gents pack remove` releases them |
| `{"install": {"graph": "<graph_id>", "slots": [...], "documents": [...]}}` | a graph pack installed from its directory into a fresh home (its dependencies pre-stored, its declared external services registered) activates this graph and binds these inference slots; a reinstall keeps the revision digest; `gents pack remove` deletes exactly these documents (ids derived from the graph digest are compared with the digest elided) |
| `{"defs": "...", "jq": [{"name": "...", "expr": "..."}]}` | each jq expression is true over one document built once per pack from a single `gents pack show --config`: `{manifest, config, scenario, assets}`, `assets` mapping every UTF-8 declared asset path to its text; `defs` is a shared prelude of jq definitions |
| `{"eval_case": {"asset": "...", "after": "..."}}` | the first json fence after that heading line of the asset is an eval case `gents eval checks --validate-case -` accepts |
| `{"cli_flags": {"command": [...], "flags": [...]}}` | `gents <command> --help` documents every flag |
| `{"runtime": {"repository": ..., "seed": ..., "taken": ..., "expect": [...]}}` | the pack installed into a fresh home and served by `gents server` from a throwaway git repository (the operator ceiling) reaches every expected document state after the seed document is created, with no model involved. `${BASE_SHA}` in a seed field is the repository's commit; `${ATTEMPT}` keeps a re-created seed unique while the runtime starts; `taken` names a row that shows the runtime picked the seed up |
| `{"install": {"plugins": [...]}}` | installed into a fresh home, a plugins pack registers exactly these plugins (`gents plugin list` agrees); a reinstall keeps the same set; `gents pack remove` releases them |

Every documents or graph pack also passes the built-in checks: it declares
inference slots and authors no inference backend, profile, sampling, execution
or retry documents; no task sets `goal_token_budget`; and every dependency is a
sibling pack directory with that coordinate, which is built and pre-stored in
the install's home. Rust plugins run their own `cargo test` when `cargo` is on
`PATH`. Scenarios (`experiment.json`) need a
model endpoint and run only on request (`gents pack test --scenario`).

```sh
make test               # every pack
make test-pipeline      # one pack
make test GENTS=path/to/gents
```

CI builds the gents CLI from gents `main` (cached per commit), then runs each
pack's suite as its own job, on every push, pull request and daily. A pack
with plugins compiles them to `wasm32-wasip1` in its job, with the compiler
`rust-toolchain.toml` pins. Compiled plugins embed build paths, so a pack's
digest is stable per build machine; the artifact to publish is the one CI
builds.
